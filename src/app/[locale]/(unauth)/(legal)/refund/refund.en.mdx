At ShipMore, we strive to ensure your satisfaction with our template and services. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds related to our template purchases and subscription plans.

## 2. Subscription Refunds
We offer refunds under the following conditions:

- **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee:** If you are not satisfied with our service, you may request a full refund within 14 days of your initial subscription purchase.
- **Technical Issues:** If you experience significant technical issues that prevent you from using our service and our support team is unable to resolve them, you may be eligible for a refund.
- **Duplicate Charges:** If you were charged multiple times for the same subscription, the duplicate charges will be refunded.
- **Service Unavailability:** If our service is unavailable for an extended period (more than 24 consecutive hours), you may be eligible for a prorated refund for the affected period.

## 3. Non-Refundable Items
The following are generally not eligible for refunds:

- **Subscription Cancellations After 14 Days:** Refunds will not be provided for subscription cancellations made after the 14-day money-back guarantee period.
- **Partial Usage:** If you have used a significant portion of the service before requesting a refund, we may deny or prorate the refund based on usage.
- **Add-on Services:** One-time purchases or add-on services may not be refundable once they have been delivered or activated.
- **Violations of Terms:** Refunds will not be provided if your account was suspended or terminated due to violations of our Terms of Service.

## 4. Refund Process
To request a refund, please follow these steps:

1. Contact our support team at support@shipmore.xyz with the subject line "Refund Request".
2. Include your account email address and the reason for your refund request.
3. Provide any relevant information or documentation that supports your refund request.

We will review your request and respond within 5 business days. If your refund is approved, it will be processed using the original payment method. Depending on your payment provider, it may take 5-10 business days for the refund to appear in your account.

## 5. Prorated Refunds
In some cases, we may offer prorated refunds based on the unused portion of your subscription. The prorated amount will be calculated from the date of the refund request to the end of the billing cycle.

## 6. Currency and Payment Processing Fees
Refunds will be issued in the same currency as the original payment. Please note that we do not refund any payment processing fees that may have been charged by your payment provider. Currency exchange rate differences may also apply if your original payment was made in a different currency.

## 7. Changes to This Refund Policy
We may update our Refund Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our business practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Refund Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
