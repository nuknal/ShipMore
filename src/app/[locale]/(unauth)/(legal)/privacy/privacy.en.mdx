# Privacy Policy

ShipMore ("we", "us") provides an application template and hosted services that include authentication, subscriptions, internationalization, and developer tooling. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1. Information We Collect
- Account information: name, email, password hash, locale and theme preferences.
- Authentication data: the profile details you choose to share from OAuth providers (e.g., name, email, avatar). We never receive your OAuth passwords.
- Billing data: processed by Stripe. We do not store full payment card numbers; Stripe acts as our payment processor.
- Usage data and logs: pages visited, actions, timestamps, truncated IP, user agent, error and performance logs to keep the service reliable.
- Devices/cookies/local storage: session cookies, anti‑fraud and CSRF tokens, locale and theme. You can control cookies in your browser.
- Support communications and feedback you send us.

## 2. How We Use Information
- Provide and operate the services (sign-in, sessions, subscriptions, localization).
- Process payments, invoices, and subscription lifecycle via Stripe.
- Secure the platform, prevent fraud/abuse, and diagnose issues.
- Improve features and performance using aggregated or de‑identified analytics from first‑party logs.
- Communicate updates, transactional emails, and support responses.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.

## 3. Sharing and Processors
We share data only with service providers that help us run ShipMore:
- Payments: Stripe (payment processing, invoicing).
- Authentication: the OAuth providers you choose to connect (e.g., Google, GitHub) – subject to their policies.
- Hosting/CDN and database/logging infrastructure that power our app.
- Support and incident tooling as needed.
We may also share when you ask us to, to comply with law, or to protect rights and safety. We do not sell personal data or use third‑party ads.

## 4. Cookies
We use: (a) strictly necessary cookies (auth/session, security), (b) preference cookies (locale, theme), and (c) limited analytics from first‑party logs. You can disable non‑essential cookies in your browser; strictly necessary cookies are required for the service to work.

## 5. Retention
We keep account data while your account is active and delete or anonymize it upon request within a reasonable timeframe. Billing records are retained as required by law. Operational logs are retained for a limited period necessary for security and reliability.

## 6. Security
Encryption in transit, access controls (least privilege), and routine updates help protect your data. No method is 100% secure; we work continuously to improve our safeguards.

## 7. International Transfers
Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual clauses).

## 8. Your Rights
Subject to local laws, you may request access, correction, deletion, export, or restriction of your personal data, and object to certain processing. Contact us using the email below. If you are in the EEA/UK or California, you may have additional rights under GDPR/CCPA/CPRA.

## 9. Children
ShipMore is not directed to children under 16. If you believe a child provided data, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## 10. Changes
We may update this Policy. Significant changes will be notified in‑app or by email. Your continued use means you accept the updated Policy.
